These tools help you to assess if a financial portfolio aligns with climate
goals. They summarize key metrics attributed to the portfolio (e.g.
production, emission factors), and calculate targets based on climate
scenarios. They implement in R the last step of the free software 'PACTA'
(Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment;
<https://www.transitionmonitor.com/>). Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to
study how their capital allocation impacts the climate.

## Installation

Install the released version of r2dii.analysis from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("r2dii.analysis")
```

Or install the development version of r2dii.analysis from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("RMI-PACTA/r2dii.analysis")
```

## Example

* Use `library()` to attach the packages you need. r2dii.analysis does not depend on the packages r2dii.data and r2dii.match; but we suggest you install them -- with `install.packages(c("r2dii.data", "r2dii.match"))` -- so you can reproduce our examples.

```{r}
library(r2dii.data)
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.analysis)
```

* Use `r2dii.match::match_name()` to identify matches between your loanbook and the asset level data.

```{r}
matched <- match_name(loanbook_demo, abcd_demo) %>%
  prioritize()
```

### Add Scenario Targets

* Use `target_sda()` to calculate SDA targets of CO2 emissions.

```{r}
matched %>%
  target_sda(
    abcd = abcd_demo,
    co2_intensity_scenario = co2_intensity_scenario_demo,
    region_isos = region_isos_demo
  )
```

* Use `target_market_share` to calculate market-share scenario targets at the portfolio level:

```{r}
matched %>%
  target_market_share(
    abcd = abcd_demo,
    scenario = scenario_demo_2020,
    region_isos = region_isos_demo
  )
```

* Or at the company level:

```{r}
matched %>%
  target_market_share(
    abcd = abcd_demo,
    scenario = scenario_demo_2020,
    region_isos = region_isos_demo,
    by_company = TRUE
  )
```
