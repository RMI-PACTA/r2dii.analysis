## Goal

These tools help you to assess if a financial portfolio aligns with climate
goals. They summarize key metrics attributed to the portfolio (e.g.
production, emission factors), and calculate targets based on climate
scenarios. They implement in R the last step of the free software 'PACTA'
(Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment;
<https://2degrees-investing.org/>). Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to
study how their capital allocation impacts the climate.

## Installation

Before you install r2dii.analysis you may want to:

* [Try an rstudio.cloud project with this package already installed](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1424833).
* [Learn how to minimize installation errors](https://gist.github.com/maurolepore/a0187be9d40aee95a43f20a85f4caed6#installation).

When you are ready, install the released version of r2dii.analysis from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("r2dii.analysis")
```

Or install the development version of r2dii.analysis from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.analysis")
```

[How to raise an issue?](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/posts/2020-06-26-instructions-to-raise-an-issue/)

## Example

* Use `library()` to attach the packages you need. r2dii.analysis does not depend on the packages r2dii.data and r2dii.match; but we suggest you install them -- with `install.packages(c("r2dii.data", "r2dii.match"))` -- so you can reproduce our examples.

```{r unlabeled-58, exercise.setup='setup'}
library(r2dii.data)
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.analysis)
```

* Use `r2dii.match::match_name()` to identify matches between your loanbook and the asset level data.

```{r unlabeled-66, exercise.setup='unlabeled-58'}
matched <- match_name(loanbook_demo, ald_demo) %>%
  prioritize()
```

### Add Scenario Targets

* Use `target_sda()` to calculate SDA targets of CO2 emissions.

```{r unlabeled-75, exercise.setup='unlabeled-66'}
matched %>%
  target_sda(
    ald = ald_demo,
    co2_intensity_scenario = co2_intensity_scenario_demo
  )
```

* Use `target_market_share` to calculate market-share scenario targets at the portfolio level:

```{r unlabeled-85, exercise.setup='unlabeled-75'}
matched %>%
  target_market_share(
    ald = ald_demo,
    scenario = scenario_demo_2020,
    region_isos = region_isos_demo
  )
```

* Or at the company level:

```{r unlabeled-96, exercise.setup='unlabeled-85'}
matched %>%
  target_market_share(
    ald = ald_demo,
    scenario = scenario_demo_2020,
    region_isos = region_isos_demo,
    by_company = TRUE
  )
```

### Utility Functions

The `target_*()` functions provide shortcuts for common operations. They wrap some utility functions that you may also use directly:

* Use `join_ald_scenario()` to join a matched dataset to the relevant
scenario data, and to pick assets in the relevant regions.

```{r unlabeled-113, exercise.setup='unlabeled-96'}
loanbook_joined_to_ald_scenario <- matched %>%
  join_ald_scenario(
    ald = ald_demo,
    scenario = scenario_demo_2020,
    region_isos = region_isos_demo
  )
```

* Use `summarize_weighted_production()` with different grouping arguments to
calculate scenario-targets:

```{r unlabeled-125, exercise.setup='unlabeled-113'}
# portfolio level
loanbook_joined_to_ald_scenario %>%
  summarize_weighted_production(scenario, tmsr, smsp, region)

# company level
loanbook_joined_to_ald_scenario %>%
  summarize_weighted_production(scenario, tmsr, smsp, region, name_ald)
```
