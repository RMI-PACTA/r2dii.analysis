Description: These datasets support the implementation in R of
    the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment),
    which is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
    assets and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
    Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
    allocation impacts the climate. Because both financial institutions
    and market data providers keep their data private, this package
    provides fake, public data to enable the development and use of
    'PACTA' in R.
